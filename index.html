    <!-- The first release of emobilis learning track -->
    <h1>Emobilis web development course</h1>
    <p>This program aims at training the youth on technologies such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python and Django to develop websites. The main focus I'd wager is on Python and Django for server side development.</p>
    <h2>Vscode Basics</h2>
    <p>This includes changing themes, installing extensions such as the liveserver extension which allows you to view your output in a browser with an automatic reload, Vscode emmets which allow for faster code writing such as "(p>lorem)*3 to create 3 paragraphs containing an automatically generated lorem paragraph.</p>
    <h3>Required tools</h3>
    <p>The required tools include Pycharm student edition, VsCode - not to be confused with Visual studio and obviously a browser to see the output of code.</p>
    <h4>Key points learned during the first lesson</h4>
    <p>This include a basic html template, including some elements that go into the head section such as title, favicon, search engine optimisation data etc. There is also the body which includes the content to be seen by the user. Some tags noted include html, head, body, p, h1 to h6 heading tags, a and img.</p>
